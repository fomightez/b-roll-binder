Binderizes that featured software and some others in order make a fancy-looking sciencing background dashboard look using Jupyter session served from MyBinder.org.

## Technical notes

I could get [DustinKirkland's Hollywood](https://github.com/dustinkirkland/hollywood), suggested [in response to Mara Averick's post](https://twitter.com/yeedle/status/1119101335238926338), to sort of start in a Binder session via MyBinder.org after installing `tmux`; however, it didn't really do much but show a little text. Weird.
