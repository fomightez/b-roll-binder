This is trying to implement that with some inspiration also added from [Mara Averick](https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1119027392838799361) and some other sources I deemed cool.

## Features
- [Artem Babaian's drawHelix.sh](https://github.com/bioSyntax/bioSyntax/blob/master/dev/scripts/drawHelix.sh)
- [Can Güney Aksakalli's gtop](https://github.com/aksakalli/gtop)
- [William Mannard's unimatrix](https://github.com/will8211/unimatrix)
- [Torsten Rehn's termdown](https://github.com/trehn/termdown)

## How to

Launch Binder session and then follow the steps below to kick things off and lay out the windows like so:

## Technical notes

I could get [DustinKirkland's Hollywood](https://github.com/dustinkirkland/hollywood), suggested [in response to Mara Averick's post](https://twitter.com/yeedle/status/1119101335238926338), to sort of start in a Binder session via MyBinder.org after installing `tmux`; however, it didn't really do much but show a little text. Weird.
